Thanks for the screenshot! I now clearly understand what you meant — you're looking for **cleaner formatting** of section headings and a **better Markdown hierarchy** for GitHub so that titles like `Login Screen` don’t look oddly large or messy.

Here is the **corrected and beautifully structured `README.md`** with improved heading levels and clean formatting.
