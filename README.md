Thanks for the clarification and the screenshots! You're right — the `README.md` content and `pubspec.yaml` structure you shared need proper formatting for markdown and Flutter. I'll correct both below.

### ✅ Corrected `README.md` (well-formatted markdown):

Save this as `README.md` in your project root:

````markdown
# 🧠 Flutter Chatbot Authentication App

A simple, clean, and well-structured Flutter application featuring login/signup authentication and a basic chatbot interface.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication

#### **Login Screen**
- Email and Password fields with validation
- Login button with state feedback
- Navigation to Signup screen

#### **Signup Screen**
- Name, Email, Password fields with validation
- Signup button
- Navigation back to Login screen

#### **Authentication Logic**
- Dummy authentication (no backend)
- Login state stored using `SharedPreferences`

---

### 💬 Chatbot
- Simple chat interface:
  - Input field for sending messages
  - List of messages (user + bot)
  - Hardcoded or logic-based dummy responses
